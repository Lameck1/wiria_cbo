      'Community Voices Take the Lead: Homa Bay Launches CLM Program to Strengthen Health Services',
    excerpt:
      'A new chapter in community-driven health accountability began in Homa Bay County with the official inception of the CLM program.',
    fullContent:
      'On 10th June 2025, a new chapter in community-driven health accountability began in Homa Bay County. Wiria CBO, in partnership with Amref Health Africa, joined stakeholders at Asumbi Gardens for the official inception of the Community-Led Monitoring (CLM) program. The event, organized by YOFAK in collaboration with Amref, brought together key players in the health ecosystem—including County Health Management Teams (CHMTs), civil society organizations (CSOs), and peer monitors.\n\nHoma Bay is no stranger to CLM. Having been part of earlier pilot efforts, the county now enters a new phase of the program with ambitious scaling goals. The initiative plans to reach 6,313 participants in 2025, expand to 8,419 in 2026, and engage over 10,500 people by mid-2027.\n\nAt the heart of the CLM approach is the idea that communities themselves are best positioned to monitor and improve the health services they receive. The focus will be on three high-impact areas: Tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and malaria—diseases that continue to challenge public health in the region.\n\nTo drive data collection from the ground up, 47 peer monitors have been deployed to cover 329 health facilities. Each monitor will work with communities and oversee seven facilities, ensuring wide coverage and strong grassroots engagement.\n\nData integrity is also a top priority. A network of “super users” at the facility, sub-county, and county levels will validate the data collected. Any issues that cannot be resolved locally will be escalated to national authorities, with solutions and updates fed back through official channels to keep communities informed and involved.\n\nThis launch marks a bold step toward more transparent, responsive, and community-centered healthcare in Homa Bay. With the voices of citizens at the core, CLM promises to be a powerful tool in the county’s ongoing fight against TB, HIV, and malaria.',
